### What courses are being replaced?

We are redesigning and replacing the following courses to build the new Foundation Courses:

* CS 2102 - Discrete Mathematics (replacement not piloted until Fall 2019)
* CS 2110 - Software Development Methods
* CS 2150 - Program and Data Representation
* CS 2190 - Computer Science Seminar
* ECE 2330 - Digital Logic Design
* CS 3102 - Theory of Computation (replacement not piloted until Fall 2019)
* CS 3240 - Advanced Software Development
* CS 3330 - Computer Architecture
* CS 4102 - Algorithms

In their place, students will take:

* Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) 1 & 2 - Covers material currently found in CS 2110, CS 2150, and CS 4102
* Discrete Mathematics and Theory (DMT) 1 & 2 - Covers material currently found in CS 2102, CS 3102, and CS 4102  (not piloted until the 2019--2020 school year)
* Computer Organization and Architecture (COA) 1 & 2 - Covers material currently found in ECE 2330 and CS 3330
* Software Development Essentials (SDE) - Covers material currently found in CS 2110, CS 2190, and CS 3240

### What courses are beign piloted in AY 2018-2019?

For the pilot, we are focusing on DSA 1 & 2, COA 1 & 2, and SDE.

### Course Descriptions

#### Data Structures and Algorithms 1 and 2 (DSA1 piloted Fall 2018, DSA2 piloted Spring 2019)
These courses principally draw content from CS 2110, CS 2150, and CS 4102, though not all of the topics from these courses are included and a few topics are pulled from some of our current electives. The sequence will help you understand how software can be designed to accomplish specific tasks and how different solutions are evaluated.

#### Computer Organization and Architecture 1 and 2 (COA1 piloted Fall 2018, COA2 piloted Spring 2019)
These courses principally draw content from CS 2150 and CS 3330, and to a lesser extent also from ECE 2330 and CS 4414, though not all of the topics from these courses are included and a few topics are pulled from some of our current electives. The sequence will help you understand how computers store data and run software and how to interact with computers at a fundamental level, including the basics of computer design, operating system functionality, and how to write and run low-level code.

#### Software Development Essentials (SDE piloted Spring 2019; not required of CAS students)
This course principally draws content from CS 3240, and to a lesser extent also from CS 2110 and CS 2190, though not all of the topics from these courses are included and a few topics are pulled from some of our current electives. This course will help you understand how software is constructed to satisfy human requirements and some of the challenges and considerations associated with meeting actual human needs.
