### Do I have to be a CS major to be in the pilot?

 

### Which pilot course meets my requirement to take CS 2110?

No one course does.
The set of pilot courses together replace a set of courses, but there is not a one-to-one relationship between pilot courses and current course numbers.
If you are in a degree program (other than CS) that requires some particular CS course, you need to take that course (or take the entire pilot).

### Can I use the pilot to get a CS minor?

If you complete the entire pilot, yes, but not by taking just a subset of its courses.

### Why are there fewer courses in the Foundation Courses than what we take now in the BSCS?  Why are there more than what we take in the BACS?

The proposed Foundation Courses is made up of fewer credits than the existing BS CS required courses, but more than the existing BA CS required courses.  The rationale for this can be seen in several ways:

* One goal is to enable unifying the BA and BS core, which requires a credit number compromise.
* Current courses have evolved to have significant content overlap which can be removed in a redesign.
* Each track will have additional required courses: the total number of required courses is not expected to decrease for any given track, only the number that are identified as Foundation.
* Some topics are being removed from the foundation and pushed to track courses or electives.

### Who will advise students in the pilot?

For advising purposes, students will continue to be advised by their current CS advisor.  Information regarding courses will be posted to this website (http://pilot.cs.virginia.edu).  A Piazza message board has been been created for pilot students and advisors to ask questions of a sub-committee of the UGCC.  Faculty and students can email cs2020pilot-questions@virginia.edu with any questions as well.  Town hall meetings will take place at least twice a semester to get feedback from pilot students and also to provide group advising as needed.
