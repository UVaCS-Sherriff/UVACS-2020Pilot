### Do I have to be a CS major to be in the pilot?

 

### Which pilot course meets my requirement to take CS 2110?

No one course does.
The set of pilot courses together replace a set of courses, but there is not a one-to-one relationship between pilot courses and current course numbers.
If you are in a degree program (other than CS) that requires some particular CS course, you need to take that course (or take the entire pilot).

### Can I use the pilot to get a CS minor?

If you complete the entire pilot, yes, but not by taking just a subset of its courses.
