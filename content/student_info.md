### Can I participate in the pilot?

Students can participate if you meet the following qualifications:

* Have declared or intend to declare the BSCS or BACS degree;
* Are currently enrolled in or have already completed our Introduction to Programming requirement; and,
* Have not yet taken CS 2110 or ECE 2330.

### What courses I will take?

Students must take following course in the semesters indicated:

__Fall 2019__

  * Data Structures and Algorithms 1 (DSA 1) w/ Prof. Floryan
  * Computer Organization and Architecture 1 (COA 1) w/ Prof. Tychonievich
  * Discrete Mathematics (our current CS 2102 course) if you have not already taken it

__Spring 2020__

  * Data Structures and Algorithms 2 (DSA 2) w/ Prof. Pettit
  * Computer Organization and Architecture 2 (COA 2) w/ Prof. Tychonievich
  * Software Development Essentials (SDE) w/ Prof. McBurney

And you will be given SIS exemptions for:

* CS 2110
* CS 2150
* CS 2190
* ECE 2330
* CS 3240
* CS 3330
* CS 4102

### Are there any special rules for BSCS students?

* To maintain credit equivalency with the current system, you will be required to take one extra CS elective (6 instead of 5).
* All other SEAS and CS requirements stay the same.

### Are there any special rules for BACS students?

* The CS Pilot is generally impractical for first-year College students because of required first-year College general education requirements.  First-year College students should consider enrolling in the “current” curriculum instead. The pilot is a better fit for second-year College students.
* BACS students in the pilot will not be required to take SDE, but can do so as one of your CS electives (counts as CS 3240).
* BACS students must take CS 3102 as one of their 4 CS Electives to complete all of the Foundation Courses (note that BS students already have to take CS 3102).
* Being in the pilot does not affect the Integration Elective requirement.
* You must successfully complete both DSA 1 and COA 1 before you can declare the major.

### Why should I take part in the pilot?

Since these are new courses, there is some uncertainty in how they will pan out. We hope and expect that participants in the pilot will:

* Experience a better-designed progression of topics with more cohesive presentation and less repetition of material;
* Gain a more current set of foundational skills and knowledge;
* Experience excellent instruction from experienced and excited instructors;
* Benefit from interacting with a smaller, more cohesive cohort of fellow students;
* Have guaranteed admittance to all pilot courses; and,
* Get to be a part of redesigning the CS curriculum for future UVA students.

### Are there any drawbacks to participating in the pilot?

There is some risk in anything new; there is some chance that participants in the pilot might:

* Be given less-refined assignments and assessments;
* Have a smaller set of fellow students and TAs to interact with;
* Be limited in scheduling non-CS courses because each pilot course is offered only once; and,
* Have unusual-looking transcripts (we will provide explanatory letters to accompany transcripts upon request).

In the unlikely event that personal circumstances necessitate withdrawing from the pilot (e.g., to handle family or other situations), we will work with you to ensure you are able to complete your degree. However, barring such circumstances the pilot will need to be taken as a whole or not at all.
