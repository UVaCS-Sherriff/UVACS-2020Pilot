### Can I participate in the pilot?

Students can participate if you meet the following qualifications:

* Have declared a BS CS major in SEAS;
* Are currently enrolled in or have already completed our Introduction to Programming requirement; and,
* Have not yet taken CS 2110 or ECE 2330.

### How can I apply to join the pilot?

See the "Apply to Join" link at the top of every page in the site!

### If I am accepted, how does that change the courses I will take?

If accepted, students will take:

* __Fall 2018__
   - Data Structures and Algorithms 1 (DSA 1)
   - Computer Organization and Architecture 1 (COA 1)
   - Discrete Mathematics (our current CS 2102 course) if you have not already taken it
* __Spring 2019__
   - Data Structures and Algorithms 2 (DSA 2)
   - Computer Organization and Architecture 2 (COA 2)
   - Software Engineering and Construction (SEC)

And you will be given SIS exemptions for:

* CS 2110
* CS 2150
* CS 2190
* ECE 2330
* CS 3240
* CS 4102

To maintain credit equivalency with the current system, you will be required to take one extra CS elective (6 instead of 5).
