<h1>UVA CS 2020 Curriculum Pilot Program</h1>

<h3>Deadline to Apply: March 30, 2018</h3>

<h2>What is the 2020 Curriculum Pilot Program?</h2>
<p>
The CS UGCC is considering changes to the undergraduate curriculum with an anticipated implementation date of Fall 2020.  The 2020 Curriculum is anticipated to consist of two broad categories of changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Revisions of the current required courses, which we will now call the <strong>Foundation Courses</strong>, designed to unify the requirements of our degrees and be the common foundation for all anticipated future courses.</li>
<li>Introduction of <strong>Tracks</strong>, sets of additional required and elective CS courses that provide students a guided opportunity to specialize.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the 2018-2019 academic year, we are going to pilot the first set of changes - namely, the Foundation Courses.  
</p>
<p>
The primary change with the Foundation Courses is <strong>a reorganization and refocusing of core content currently found in the first several CS courses</strong>. Because this involves moving several topics across current course boundaries, we cannot change the courses one at a time, requiring instead the large-scale adjustment we are inviting you to participate in. While none of the material in the pilot courses is new to the department, its organization and order of presentation is, which is why we want to try out a smaller-scale first run before we deliver the classes to all students.
</p>
<h2>What courses are being replaced?</h2>
<p>
	We are redesigning and replacing the following courses to build the new Foundation Courses:
	<ul>
		<li>CS 2102 - Discrete Mathematics</li>
		<li>CS 2110 - Software Development Methods</li>
		<li>CS 2150 - Program and Data Representation</li>
		<li>CS 2190 - Computer Science Seminar</li>
		<li>ECE 2330 - Digital Logic Design</li>
		<li>CS 3102 - Theory of Computation</li>
		<li>CS 3240 - Advanced Software Development</li>
		<li>CS 3330 - Computer Architecture</li>
		<li>CS 4102 - Algorithms</li>
	</ul>
	In their place, students will take:
	<ul>
		<li>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) 1 &amp; 2</li> - Covers material currently found in CS 2110, CS 2150, and CS 4102
		<li>Discrete Mathematics and Theory (DMT) 1 &amp; 2</li> - Covers material currently found in CS 2102, CS 3102, and CS 4102
		<li>Computer Organization and Architecture (COA) 1 &amp; 2</li> - Covers material currently found in ECE 2330 and CS 3330
		<li>Software Engineering and Construction (SEC)</li> - Covers material currently found in CS 2110, CS 2190, and CS 3240
	</ul>
	For the 2018-2019 school year, we are focusing on DSA 1 &amp; 2, COA 1 &amp; 2, and SEC.
</p>

<h2>Who can participate?</h2>
<p>
Students can participate if you meet the following qualifications:
<ul>
	<li>Have declared or intend to declare the BSCS degree;</li>
	<li>Are currently enrolled in or have already completed our Introduction to Programming requirement; and,</li>
	<li>Have not yet taken CS 2110 or ECE 2330.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong>Students that are interested in the BACS degree are allowed to apply and we may choose a set of potential BACS majors over the summer to join the program if there is space.  BACS requirements will be different than the ones listed below.<br><br>
<strong>The deadline for applying to join is Friday, March 30, 2018!</strong><br>
