<h1></h1>UVA CS - 2020 Curriculum Pilot Program</h1>

<h2>What is the 2020 Curriculum Pilot Program?</h2>
<p>
The CS UGCC is considering changes to the undergraduate curriculum with an anticipated implementation date of Fall 2020.  The 2020 Curriculum is anticipated to consist of two broad categories of changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Revisions of the current required courses, referred to herein as the Foundation Courses, designed to unify the requirements of our degrees and be the common foundation for all anticipated future courses.</li>
<li>Introduction of Tracks, sets of additional required and elective CS courses that provide students a guided opportunity to specialize.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the 2018-2019 academic year, we are going to pilot the first set of changes - namely, the Foundation Courses.  
</p>
<p></p>
The primary change with the Foundation Courses is __a reorganization and refocusing of core content currently found in the first several CS courses__. Because this involves moving several topics across current course boundaries, we cannot change the courses one at a time, requiring instead the large-scale adjustment we are inviting you to participate in. While none of the material in the pilot courses is new to the department, its organization and order of presentation is, which is why we want to try out a smaller-scale first run before we deliver the classes to all students.
</p>
<h2>What courses are being replaced?</h2>

<h2>Who can participate?</h2>
