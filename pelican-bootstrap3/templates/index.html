<h1>UVA CS 2020 Curriculum Pilot Program</h1>

<h2>Info for the 2019-2020 Academic Year Pilot</h2>
<p>
After a successful pilot in the 2018-2019 Academic Year, we will be running the pilot courses again during the 2019-2020 Academic Year.
</p>
<p>
	Students can participate if you meet the following qualifications:
<ul>
	<li>Have declared or intend to declare the BSCS or BACS degree;</li>
	<li>Are currently enrolled in or have already completed our Introduction to Programming requirement; and,</li>
	<li>Have not yet taken CS 2110 or ECE 2330.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Info for Incoming First Year Students (Class of 2023)</h2>

If you are:
<ul>
	<li>an incoming first year SEAS student;</li>
	<li>have credit for CS 1110;</li>
	<li>are interested in majoring in Computer Science; and,</li>
	<li>want to take several CS courses in your first year</li>
</ul>
you may be interested in participating in the CS 2020 Curriculum Pilot.  For more informaiton, please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1esOQQzBNSdaqjaaDFu3IZenMF8szbSURsP0aNKxRqXI/edit?usp=sharing">the First Year Info Sheet <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span></a> or look through the rest of this site.

Feel free to email <a href="mailto:cs2020pilot-questions@virginia.edu">cs2020pilot-questions@virginia.edu</a> with any questions.  This address will be monitored throughout SEAS orientation.

<h2>What is the 2020 Curriculum Pilot Program?</h2>
<p>
The CS UGCC is considering changes to the undergraduate curriculum with an anticipated implementation date of Fall 2020.  The 2020 Curriculum is anticipated to consist of two broad categories of changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Revisions of the current required courses, which we will now call the <strong>Foundation Courses</strong>, designed to unify the requirements of our degrees and be the common foundation for all anticipated future courses.</li>
<li>Introduction of <strong>Tracks</strong>, sets of additional required and elective CS courses that provide students a guided opportunity to specialize.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the 2019-2020 Academic Year, we are repeating the pilot of the first set of changes - namely, the Foundation Courses.  
</p>
<p>
The primary change with the Foundation Courses is <strong>a reorganization and refocusing of core content currently found in the first several CS courses</strong>. Because this involves moving several topics across current course boundaries, we cannot change the courses one at a time, requiring instead the large-scale adjustment we are inviting you to participate in. While none of the material in the pilot courses is new to the department, its organization and order of presentation is, which is why we want to try out a smaller-scale first run before we deliver the classes to all students.
</p>
<h2>What courses are being reorganized?</h2>
<p>
	We are redesigning the following courses to build the new Foundation Courses:
	<ul>
		<li>CS 2102 - Discrete Mathematics</li>
		<li>CS 2110 - Software Development Methods</li>
		<li>CS 2150 - Program and Data Representation</li>
		<li>CS 2190 - Computer Science Seminar</li>
		<li>ECE 2330 - Digital Logic Design</li>
		<li>CS 3102 - Theory of Computation</li>
		<li>CS 3240 - Advanced Software Development</li>
		<li>CS 3330 - Computer Architecture</li>
		<li>CS 4102 - Algorithms</li>
	</ul>
	In their place, students will take:
	<ul>
		<li>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) 1 &amp; 2</li> - Covers material currently found in CS 2110, CS 2150, and CS 4102
		<li>Discrete Mathematics and Theory (DMT) 1 &amp; 2</li> - Covers material currently found in CS 2102, CS 3102, and CS 4102
		<li>Computer Organization and Architecture (COA) 1 &amp; 2</li> - Covers material currently found in ECE 2330 and CS 3330
		<li>Software Development Essentials (SDE)</li> - Covers material currently found in CS 2110, CS 2190, and CS 3240
	</ul>
	For the 2019-2020 school year, we are focusing on DSA 1 &amp; 2, COA 1 &amp; 2, and SDE.
